# win-sketchy
ZX81 screen design program.

Built in c++ on windows using the olcPixelGameEngine.

The idea was it could then be cross-platform but quickly I hammered in windows specific code so until I can work that out it remains windows only. #sadface. 

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/charlierobson/win-sketchy/wiki) for a users guide etc.
